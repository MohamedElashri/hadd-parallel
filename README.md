# Parallel Hadd

This is a python package to allow usage of hadd (from ROOT CERN) in parallel. It allows adding histogram and `.root` files. The addition will occur in blocks instead of one at all. It was designed to work with limited memory (local development primilary). The addition will use `multiprocessing` if avilable in your python enviroment. 

## Requirements:
The minimum supported python version is 3.6.
